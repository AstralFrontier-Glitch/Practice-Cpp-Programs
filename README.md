Practice-Cpp-Programs
I'm new to this and I want to track my progress via uploading my source codes here!

As a Second-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student. 
I still find it hard to write even a simple program or analyze such code.

This repository is to see whether am I truly learning something or not..

I did not wished for this program anyway (I've always wanted to be an Architect but fate brought me here).
Anyways thank you!

Idk if you can comment in GitHub but it will be highly appreciated if you can & actually leave a comment hahah.
Like for tips, what to practice, how to practice and most importantly why do I need to practice.
